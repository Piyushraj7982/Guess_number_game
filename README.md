## Introduction

The **Guess the Number Game** is an interactive game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player has to guess a number within a specified range, and the game provides hints whether the guess is too high or too low. It's a great project to practice basic web development skills and understand the interaction between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

2. **Enter Your Guess**: Type your guess into the input field.
3. **Submit Your Guess**: Click the "Check" button to see if your guess is correct.
4. **Get Feedback**: The game will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
5. **Continue Guessing**: Keep guessing until you find the correct number.
6. **Win the Game**: Once you guess the correct number, you'll be notified of your success and your score.
